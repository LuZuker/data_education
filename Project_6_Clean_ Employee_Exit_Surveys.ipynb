    "##### Clean the Service Column\n",
    "We'll clean the institute_service column and categorize employees according to the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New: Less than 3 years in the workplace\n",
    "- Experienced: 3-6 years in the workplace\n",
    "- Established: 7-10 years in the workplace\n",
    "- Veteran: 11 or more years in the workplace\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis is based:\n",
    "- Newbie (3 years or less at the company): These employees are least invested in company culture and the most transient, viewing the risk of switching jobs to be low. The top motivator for 59 percent of those in the newbie career stage is learning new skills or gaining new knowledge. They’re eager to learn through experience over formalized training programs. Employees in the newbie stage are challenged by not meeting personal goals or expectations and prefer managers that will offer guidance and feedback.\n",
    "- Sophomore (4-7 years at the company): These employees are learning in the moment and focused on proving themselves, but 29 percent also fear getting stuck or not feeling challenged enough. At this career stage, employees pay more attention to ethics, transparency and honest communications, expect more frequent communications from supervisors and place the highest value on work-life balance.\n",
    "- Tenured (8-10 years at the company): The top motivator for 58 percent of employees in the tenured stage is to contribute to the company’s overall goals. They focus more on what success looks like, are motivated by public recognition and promotion and seek ownership over specific projects or teams. The biggest challenge for the tenured stage is combatting stagnation and feeling “stuck.” It’s important for them to have open, direct conversations with their managers to help look for opportunities to further their career and find ways to overcome any barriers.\n",
    "- Sage (11 years or more at the company): With 76 percent of employees in the sage stage considering themselves loyal to their organization, they are the most loyal and engaged career stage overall and have one of the highest Net Promoter Scores. They typically fill more senior or leadership positions, which afford them leverage to dictate the ways they are engaged. They are less focused on building social relationships or credibility, as they have already established this, and are apprehensive about “life after work.” Legacy building is a pride-based motivation and is more often manifested in projects over people. Sage employees place the most emphasis on a company’s value and culture and should be increasingly engaged with projects that build a piece of the organization’s future.\n",
    "Which makes the argument that understanding employee's needs according to career stage instead of age is more effective."
